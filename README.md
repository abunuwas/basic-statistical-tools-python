# basic-statistical-tools-python

I plan to include in this repository a number of basic
statistical tools implemented in Python.
Most, if not all of these tools probably have already
been implemented. I don't pretend to have better
implementations than those already which already exist. 
This is, more than anything else, a learning journey. 
Implementing these tools helps me get better familiarized
with the statistical concepts behind them. Besides,
having personal implementations always allows for
better customization of the tools for everyone's needs, 
and I do pretend to use them later in other projects. 
Most of these tools are inspire by the introductory
course to statistics that Sebastian Thrun created 
for Udacity. 

Jose Antonio Haro Peralta.
